features:
	-Single Player game mode with easy ai (since decision tree would never let you win)
	-Multi Player game mode using matchmaking server (using the network permission and internet resources)
	-Username and record (win, loss, draw) are saved to a local SQLite database
	-Makes use of 2D rendering

IMPORTANT NOTE
	-the default server IP in settings may not be the active server location, if this is the 
	case i will try to keep an up to date IP of the server logged in the IP.txt file


Tic Tac Toe Server
	-A simple http server used to match players for online play
	-there is no GUI so jar must be run from terminal or command prompt
